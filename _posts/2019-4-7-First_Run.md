title: First Run!
---

Today I went out on my first run in my new pair of shoes that I bought a few weeks ago. Spring feels like it's just around the corner and today was a beautiful 50 degrees. I live just a few blocks from the lakeshore trail in Chicago where I'll be doing a lot of my training.

I headed South on the trail from my apartment on Briar Pl in Lakeview East made it to North Ave beach, where I crossed the pedestrian bridge over Lakeshore Drive and looped back home. I felt a little tenderness in my left knee, and walked most of the second half. I felt similar discomfort the same knee in yoga last week, so I will keep an eye on that and work on stretching it well before my next run. Overall the new Mizunos felt great.

My [official training program](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/novice-1-marathon/) is 18 weeks and wont commence until June, so the next 2 months are an opportunity to get back into running shape after not running regularly since high school. During this period, I will be working to focus on my form and breathing, so it comes as second nature in June.
