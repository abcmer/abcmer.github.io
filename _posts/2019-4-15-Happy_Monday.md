Just a day after Chicago's April blizzard, the snow has melted and its 50 degrees again. I took the North Ave beach loop in revese today. I felt some tightness in my left thigh in the first half so stopped for some stretching at the bridge. That did the trick, and I felt good on the way home. I turned it on the last half mile to test myself and felt solid. Logan made some chicken and wild rice soup today in the Instapot which I will be chowing shortly.
