After a few cold and rainy weeks, I got back on the trail today for my longest run yet, 5.66 miles. It looks to be the warmest day of the year so far at 79 degrees, but I got out before 9am when it was a sunny 50 degrees. My body felt good during and afterwards. This bodes well for official training which is set to start next month. I'm looking forward to get out in the sun this afternoon and enjoy a few cold ones by the lake.
