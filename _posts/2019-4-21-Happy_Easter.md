title: Happy Easter

Today I returned from a 4 day roadtrip with my buddies Jake and Sam to Mammoth Cave KY, Louisville KY, and Bloomington IN. We caught some rain so I wasn't able to get out for a run despite packing my Mizunos. Arriving in Wheaton today to enjoy Easter brunch, the weather was perfect in the mid 70's for a run. I took a trip down memory lane, running to Northside park and taking 2 laps around the lake before returning home for a total of 3.52 miles. I was as comfortable as I've been since starting this blog, experiencing no discomfort in my left knee. There were many families out, enjoying the day in the park. Looking forward to another warm day tomorrow for running.
