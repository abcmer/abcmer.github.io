title: Ready for the weekend
---

It was a comfortable 62 degrees today, so I decided to start the weekend off with a nice 4 mile run. I'm feel pretty comforatble doing a 3-4 mile run now, increasing my speed a bit from earlier runs. Logan and I are staying in this evening, cooking up some [Mustard Roasted Chicken](https://theviewfromgreatisland.com/ina-gartens-mustard-roasted-chicken/), enjoying some adult beverages and good company. Have a good weekend!
