Perfect day for running this morning, around 54 and sunny. It Felt great to get up and run before work, something I will have to get more and more used to as I starting doing longer runs. I repeated my same loop to Recreation drive tennis courts that I did yesterday, this time a bit faster. My left knee felt the best it has in all three runs, but I don't want to push it yet.

**Recreation Drive Loop** 2.84 miles
