title: A very long walk

This Sunday, I went out on an urban hike totaling around 10 miles. Starting from home in Lakeview, I headed South along the lake shore trail to Oak Street Beach where I started down Michigan Ave. I checked out a newish food court, Aster Hall, but didn't purchase anything. They serve Small Cheval burgers so Logan and I will have to make it back there. I made a pit stop at the Drake hotel to mess around on the hotel lobby piano, playing through a few songs to the pleasure of a few meandering guests then continued on my way.

Heading down the Magnificant Mile, I descended down to the river walk that runs along Wacker Ave. It was a crisp yet sunny 45 degrees and felt comfortable with my winter coat on. I took the river walk West, eventually getting back up to street level and moving towards Halsted St. I took a straight shot up Halsted back to Lakeview and home.

Even though I didn't run, I can feel the burn in my legs and am ready for a well deserved nap this afternoon.
