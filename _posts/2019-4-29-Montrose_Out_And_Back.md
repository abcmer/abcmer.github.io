title: Montrose Out and Back

Today definitely felt like a Monday. I finished up work around 5 and did not have much motivation to get out and run, especially after having a LATE lunch at 3:30pm due to to some meetings. Nevertheless, I laced up and got out on the lakeshore trail with a goal of doing at least 3 miles. It was about 50 degrees and damp after raining this morning. I felt pretty comfortable wearning my jogging pants and light REI hoodie.

Note to self: Don't eat pizza for lunch so late if you are going to run.

**Very Long Walk** 3.79 miles
