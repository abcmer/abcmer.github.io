It was another 50 degree day which is a real treat after a tough Chicago winter. I woke up an ran around 8am, did about 10 minutes of stretching, and was out the door heading north this time on the lakeshore trail. I did a loop that was just under 3 miles up to the Recreation Drive tennis courts. I took it pretty easy but went the whole way without stopping today.

I attempted to do some pullups down in the park afterwards at one of those little workout stations. It did not go well. Note to self: get stronger.

Felt good to burn some carbs before going out to [Joe's Seafood](https://www.joes.net/chicago/) for brunch with my familiy to celebrate my parents and wife's birthdays which are all in April.
