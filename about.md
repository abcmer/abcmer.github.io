My name is Adam and I am currently training for my first marathon, the [2019 Chicago Marathon](https://www.chicagomarathon.com/). This blog will document my workouts, state of mind, diet, and music I run to throughout my training. My profile image is pizza because thats what I will be chowing after I finish the marathon on October 13th.
